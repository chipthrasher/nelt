# Nelt Map

## What is the Nelt?

The Nelt is a Nether ice road highway on the [Elgeis](https://www.elgeis.com) geopolitical Minecraft server. It is based on a specific [game mechanic](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/The_Nether#Traits) where each block in the Nether counts for 8 blocks in the overworld, making traveling in the Nether a highly efficient way to get around. It is structured by a grid system of ice roads, allowing players to run, fly, or boat across at high speeds. Main lines are located 100 blocks apart, and each portal connects to the nearest line, with some exceptions.

## What is the Nelt Map?

The Nelt map provides Elgeis players with an easy way to navigate the Nelt. It displays ice roads (lines) and Nether portals (circles), overlayed onto a map of the political claims of each nation on the server. Additionally, a searchable list of portals is located on the right side of the screen. 

I originally drew the Nelt map manually, but with a growing server population, it became hard to maintain. The current system imports its data from a live Google Sheet which is maintained by Elgeis players. 

The map is made entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Using [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com), the map zooms in and out, vectors scaling smoothly.
